# Magic Coverage



Magic Coverage is a single-page app with resources for players of Magic: The Gathering, one of the most popular card games on the market.

  - Find tournaments on Twitch
  - Watch individual rounds
  - See player and deck data for each round
  - Check out the competition before facing them in battle



## Built With:
  - MySQL and Sequelize
  - D3 Graphing Library
  - Node.js, Express.js, and Handlebars.js
 
> Magic players are constantly pushing the game forward and players need all the 
> information they can get when selecting the right deck for their next tournament.
> This app is designed to take the drudgery out of watching "game tape." We have 
> created a database of Twitch coverage links, players, and decks so users can see
> their competition in action.
  


## Our Favorite Features

* [D3js](https://d3js.org/)- JS library for including charts in your data driven documents
* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) - UI boilerplate
* [node.js] - the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
* [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) - JS framework for HTML templating
